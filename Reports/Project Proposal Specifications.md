## Introduction

The introduction must be the opening section of the proposal. It acts as the "elevator pitch" of the project, briefly introducing the objective, its importance, and the proposed solution. Because readers may only read this section, it should effectively capture their attention and encourage them to read further.

Toward the end of the introduction, include a subsection that outlines what the proposal will cover. This helps set reader expectations for the ensuing sections.


## Formulating the Problem

Formulating the problem or objective involves clearly defining it through background information, specifications, and constraints. Think of it as "fencing in" the objective to make it unambiguously clear what is and is not being addressed and why.

Questions to consider:
- Who does the problem affect (i.e. who is your customer)?

  The primary customer for this project is Lochinvar, specifically the engineering team is responsible 
for the design, testing, and in control of their commerical water heating systems. The main product
that could benefit from the results of this project is the Regent Commercial Instantaneous Water
Heater. Even though the Regent is the intended application, the equipment currently available for 
testing at the Tennessee Tech lab consists of Lochinvar Knight KHB085 and WHB199 fire tube boilers.
Lochinvar also pointed out that a recirculation loop, pump, flow sensor, and temperature sensors can
be provided if testing on Lochinvar hardware is needed. 

The problem also affects the people and facilities that use commerical domestic hot water systems. 
The systems need to supply hot water accurately despte if demand changes. From an engineering stand-
point, Lochinvar is interested in determining whteher the circulation pump can work at a lower speed 
when circulation isn't needed. Rather than treating the pump as a component that always needs to work 
at a constant, unneeded high speed, the project looks into if the pump can be more equivalent to the 
demands of the water heating system. The project proposal from Lochinvar specifically wants our team
to run the internal circulation pump at different speeds while changing the flow rate/inlet water
temperature and then measuring how the changes affect the performance of the system. 

Therefore, our Lochinvar needs engineering data and a control strategy that can demonstrate how and 
when the circulation pump speed can be reduced without sacrificing the predicted performance of the 
water heater. The results from our project could help Lochinvar decide if variable speed circulation 
control will benefit them for the Regent system and how that control could be implemented. 

- Why do we need this solution?

  
- What challenges necessitate a dedicated, multi-person engineering team?

  
- Why aren’t off-the-shelf solutions sufficient?

### Background


Hot water systems provide heated water for applications such as showers, baths, laundry, kitchen sinks, and other units. These systems must be capable of responding to frequent changes in hot water demands while maintaining the required water temperature and flow.

Some systems use Instantaneous water heating which is the process of using a tankless water heater that will heat up the water only when you need it. The process starts with cold water entering the unit to be heated by a heating element then delivered at the desired temperature of the customer.

The Regent Commercial Tankless Water Heater is the target system being investigated in this project. The Regent is designed as a tankless water heater that heats water as it passes through the system rather than storing hot water in a tank. Cold water, referred to as the inlet water, enters the system and flows through the heat exchanger. This is where thermal energy is transferred from the heating system to the water. The heated water, referred to as the outlet water, then exits the unit at the required temperature. If additional heating is needed, water can be recirculated through the heat exchanger to increase its temperature before being delivered to the system.

The purpose of a heat exchanger is to be able to transfer thermal energy to the water, creating the desired supply of hot water without the two ever coming in direct contact. To understand heat exchangers better and how to reach desired temperatures, it's good to understand the relationship when a system at a higher temperature is in contact with a system at a lower temperature. The rate of heat transferred to the water can be described by:

$$
Q_h = c \ m_V \ \Delta T 
$$

where Q_h represents the rate of heat transferred to the water, m_V represents the mass flow rate, c is the specific heat capacity of water(constant), and ∆T is the temperature change (Tout-Tin). Tout and Tin represent the outlet and inlet water temperatures. This relationship demonstrates the connection between water flow and temperature change within the system. As the circulation flow rate changes, the amount of temperature increase required to transfer a given amount of thermal energy also changes. This relationship will be used as a foundation for modeling the thermal response of the system.

Flow rate describes the amount of water moving through the system over a given period also expressed as volumetric flow rate,

$$
Q_V = \frac{V}{t}
$$

Where Q_V is the volumetric flow rate, V is the volume of water, and t is the time.

Flow rate can also be expressed as mass flow rate, which describes the mass of water moving through the system over a given period:

$$
m_V = \frac{m}{t}
$$

Where m_V is the mass flow rate, m is the mass, and t is the time.

The relationship between volumetric and mass flow rate is: 

$$
m_V = \rho Q_V
$$

Where ρ is the density of water.These relationships allow changes in the volumetric flow rate of water to be related to the mass flow rate used in the heat transfer equation.

The demand for hot water is never stagnant, it is constantly changing. An increase in demand results in an increase in flow and requires the system to respond while maintaining the desired temperature. A flow sensor can detect changes in demand, allowing a variable speed pump to adjust its operation accordingly. This provides the foundation for matching pump operation to system demand rather than continuously operating at maximum capacity.

Electrical power is the rate at which electrical energy is used by a system. Power can be expressed as: 

$$
P = VI
$$

where P is electrical power, V is voltage, and I is current. 

The total electrical energy consumed depends on both power and operating time:

$$
E = Pt
$$

A circulation pump operating at a higher speed generally requires more electrical power. If the pump operates at maximum capacity when the system does not require maximum flow, unnecessary energy can be consumed. A variable speed pump can adjust its operation based on the required flow rate, potentially reducing power consumption during periods of lower demand. For the proposed system, monitoring and controlling pump operation can therefore help maintain the required hot water performance while reducing unnecessary electrical energy consumption.

Energy efficiency involves meeting the required system performance while using as little energy as possible. In a hot water system, the circulation pump does not necessarily need to operate at maximum speed under all operating conditions. Reducing pump speed when demand is lower can reduce unnecessary electrical power consumption.

However, reducing pump speed too much can also affect system performance by decreasing flow and potentially increasing the time required to reach or maintain the desired temperature. Therefore, the goal is to not just minimize pump speed, but to find a balance between energy consumption and system performance.

A variable speed pump provides a way to adjust flow according to system demand. By supplying only the flow needed for the current operating condition, the system can potentially reduce unnecessary energy use while still meeting the required temperature and response time requirements. This balance between efficiency and performance is a key consideration in the proposed system.

### Specifications and Constraints

Specifications and constraints define the system's requirements. They can be positive (do this) or negative (don't do that). They can be mandatory (shall or must) or optional (may). They can cover performance, accuracy, interfaces, or limitations. Regardless of their origin, they must be unambiguous and impose measurable requirements.

#### Specifications

Specifications are requirements imposed by **stakeholders** to meet their needs. If a specification seems unattainable, it is necessary to discuss and negotiate with the stakeholders.

#### Constraints

Constraints often stem from governing bodies, standards organizations, and broader considerations beyond the requirements set by stakeholders.

Questions to consider:
- Do governing bodies regulate the solution in any way?
- Are there industrial standards that need to be considered and followed?
- What impact will the engineering, manufacturing, or final product have on public health, safety, and welfare?
- Are there global, cultural, social, environmental, or economic factors that must be considered?
